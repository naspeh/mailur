## [Mailur] is a lightweight webmail inspired by Gmail

**Mission:** bring innovations into webmail.

### Features
- multiple tags for messages (no folders)
- easy to switch from threads view to messages view
- manually linking threads
- composing messages with [Markdown][]
- independent split pane
- slim and compact interface with few basic themes
- ...

Brand-new version [uses Dovecot][gh09] as the main storage, no database required.

This version is already in use. It has minimal feature set I need on daily basis. I have a lot of ideas for further development, just need free time to implement all of them.
